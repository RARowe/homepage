		<h2 id="">dj stretch</h2>
		<p>my (possibly former) alter ego as a dj. i'm not sure if i will post any mixes on this page</p>
		<p>i used to maintain a soundcloud page, but something funny happened. upon logging in for the first time in almost a year, i saw that i had received a message from another dj stretch. this dj stretch was in st petersburg, and wanted me to relinquish my soundcloud url to him because me having it was somehow interfering with his work. the message had been sent a few weeks prior. when i checked my page, he somehow managed to get the url anyway. i guess he petitioned soundcloud. i thought about fighting it, but the idea of an "anonymous russian on the internet" scared me away</p>
		<p>anyway, here is the dj drop that i used when i was active. the voice is my brother's. if you listen closely, you can here my mom laughing at the end</p>
