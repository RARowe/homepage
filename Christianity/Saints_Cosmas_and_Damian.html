			<p>"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give." - Matthew 10:8 (KJV)</p>
			<p>Saints Cosmas and Damian were brothers born in the 3rd century in asia minor to their Godly mother Saint Theodota (yes, she is also a Saint). as they grew, both became skilled physicians, and traveled to those in need, giving away their services for free. for this reason, they are known as the "Unmercenaries".</p>
			<p>Unmercenary... what does this mean? a mercenary is a person "primarily concerned with making money at the expense of ethics" (source: google). therefore, an un-mercenary is a person "not concerned with making money, and does so for the good of all".</p>
			<p>in our own lives, whether we have money, talents, friends, extra food, kindness, a good listening ear, etcetera, let us give freely from ourselves!</p>
			<p><b>May Saints Cosmas and Damian pray to Christ for us, that He may give us the opportunity to use our gifts for the glory of the Kingdom of God!</b></p>
