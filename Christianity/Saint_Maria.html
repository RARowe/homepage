			<p>Saint Maria of Paris was born in latvia, in the late part of the 19th century. after her father's death, she adopted an atheistic worldview, and moved to St. Petersburg. in russia, she became involved in radical circles, marrying a bolshevik, and serving as a communist deputy mayor of anapa, following the revolution.</p>
			<p>she later became disenchanted with communism, and rediscovered the Orthodox Christianity of her youth, ultimately bringing her to paris to flee from persecution. while in paris, she took up a monastic vow to serve as "a mother for all who need maternal care, assistance, or protection".</p>
			<p>her ministry really took root during the german occupation of paris. she provided jewish people with Baptismal certificates to escape the gastapo. her nun's habit allowed her to enter many places most people would not be allowed, including the velodrome d'hiver sports stadium. at the time, the stadium was housing 6,900 jews (two-thirds being children) following a mass arrest. by her efforts, she was able to distribute food to the people inside, and sneak a number of children out.</p>
			<p>for helping the jewish people of paris, Saint Maria was sent to a concentration camp. while at the camp, she was recalled as always being in good spirits, led discussions on religion, and would hold Compline services in the camps following readings of the New Testament. she was a friend and light of hope to everyone she encountered.</p>
			<p>Saint Maria was sent to the gas chambers on Good Friday in 1945, and entered into eternal life the following day.</p>
			<p><b>May Saint Maria pray to Christ for us, that He may grant us true bravery in the midst of adversity!</b></p>
